# Digit-Classifier-project
# 🖥️ MNIST Digit Classifier (PyTorch)

A simple **handwritten digit classifier** built with **PyTorch** and trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).  
This project demonstrates the basics of deep learning: building a neural network, training, evaluating, and saving the model.

## 📌 Features
- Fully connected neural network implemented in PyTorch  
- Trains on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training + 10,000 testing images)  
- Achieves >97% accuracy in just a few epochs  
- Saves trained model (`mnist_model.pth`) for reuse
